        <h1>Los Pollos Hermanos</h1>
        <p>Hi! And welcome to the Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant. Here we prepare fresh fried chicken. Science 1980â€™s we have been prepareing our delicates using the best ingredients out there.
            Why choose us you may ask? Well we have a big history behind. The recipe has been kept the same science 1980 and from that moment our restaurant has caught on.
            We daily have over 300 customers that are very satisfied with our services and our food and we treat everyone the same, no matter your skin colour, country, etc.
            Are you vegan? No problem. With our new recipe, you can experience the same delicious taste of our food without consuming chicken meat.
            As we stated earlier we only use fresh ingredients and seasoning that means: our chicken is not congealed, our potatoes are collected freshly every single day and we don't use artificial seasoning.
            Are you allergic to peanut or gluten? No problem! We care about our customers and about their health so you can tell the waiter and the she will suggest you a meal that fits your needs.
            We also care about sanity and cleanilles. Everyday before we open we clean our restaurant we clean to make sure there is no dirt.
            Hope we have convinced you to come around and see how we prepare our delicates. You can find the location <a href="location.html">here</a>.
